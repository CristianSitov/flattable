-------

> For more detailed examples, please review the [tests](https://github.com/tkeer/flattable/tree/master/tests)

***Basic DB structure***

1. We have books, publishers, countries, and reading_activities tables
2. A book belongs to a publisher
3. A publisher belongs to a country
4. A reading activity has a book

### Add books in book's flattable
> also updates/deletes when related book is updated or deleted

in `getFlattableConfig()` method of the `Book` model

```php
public function getFlattableConfig(): array
{
  [
    [

      'columns' => [

        //flattable column => 'source model column'
        'name' => 'name',
        'published_at' => 'published_at',
        'publisher_id' => 'publisher_id',
        'book_id' => 'id'

      ],

      // type of relationship b/w flattable and model
      'type' => 'primary',

      // how to find related entry in the flattable table
      'wheres' => [

        // key is flattable column
        // value is column of source table (book)
        'book_id' => 'id',

      ],

      'flattable' => 'books_flattable',
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Publisher in the book's flattable.
> it also updates flattable with new publisher when book's publisher is changed

Extend flattable config used above, and add config for publisher under `changes` key.

```php
public function getFlattableConfig(): array
{
  [

    [

      'flattable' => 'books_flattable',
      ...

      'changes' => [

        // foreign colum name
        // we will update changes data only if this column is update(dirty)

        'publisher_id' => [

          'columns' => [

            'publisher_first_name' => 'first_name',
            'publisher_last_name' => 'last_name',

          ],   

          // talbe name of the source
          'table' => 'publishers',
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
}

```

### Country of the publisher in book's flattable

```php
[
    //inside pubilsher config of books flattable
    ...
    'changes' => [
        'country_id' => [
            'columns' => [
                'publisher_country_name' => 'name',
                'publisher_country_id' => 'id',
            ],
            'where' => [
                'id' => 'country_id'
            ],
            'table' => 'countries'
        ]
    ]
]
```

you can go as many nested level as you want using `changes` attribute, ie `changes` attribute within `changes` attribute.

### Update book's flattable on publisher update

In `flattableConfig()` of the `Publisher` model

```php
public function flattableConfig()
{
  return [
    [
      'columns' => [
          'publisher_first_name' => 'first_name',
          'publisher_last_name' => 'last_name',
      ],
      'wheres' => [
          'publisher_id' => 'id',
      ],
      'type' => 'secondary',

      'flattable' => 'books_flattable',
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Update book's flattable on country update
> Assigns null values to flattable when country is deleted

In `flattableConfig()` of the `Country` model

```php
public function flattableConfig()
{
  return [
    [
      'columns' => [
          'publisher_country_name' => 'name',
          'publisher_country_id' => 'id',
      ],
      'wheres' => [
          'publisher_country_id' => 'id',
      ],
      'type' => 'secondary',

      'flattable' => 'books_flattable',
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Books in Publisher's flat table
In `Book` model

```php
public function flattableConfig(): array
{
  ...
  return [
            [
            'columns' => [
                'id' => 'id',
                'name' => 'name'
            ],

            // use type many when you want to store more than one entry in a column
            'type' => 'many',

            'wheres' => [
                'publisher_id' => 'publisher_id',
            ],
            //only delete from old if these keys have changed
            'delete_from_old_keys' => ['publisher_id'],

            'flattable' => 'publishers_flattable',

            // column name of the flaatable, in which the data should be stored.
            'flattable_column_name' => 'books',
        ]
  ]
}

```


Config array explanation
-------------

Flattable config has following attributes

#### 1. columns

An array which holds the mapping of flattable columns and source table columns.

Each key in the columns array is the name of the flattable column, and the value is the name of source table column.

```php
[
  'columns' => [
    'book_id' => 'id',
    'book_name' => 'name'
  ]
]
```
#### 2. wheres

An associate array of conditions to map related entry in the flattable.

The key in the sub-array is column name of the flattable and value is column name of the source table.

```php
[
  'wheres' => [
    'book_id' => 'id'
  ]
]
```

#### 3. flattable

Name of the flattable.

#### 4. changes

Include related tables data into the flattable. It should be an associate array.

The key of each array in the changes attribute should be the column name of the source table, whose change loads
the related data in the flattable.

#### 5. type

It describes the relation type b/w flattable and source table

we have three types

##### 1. primary

create, update, and delete do the same operation
for the flattable.

For example, books relation with books_flattable

##### 2. secondary

Same as primary, but deleting model will not delete the related entry in the flattable.
Instead it will assign null values to the related columns in the flattable.

For example, publishers relationship with books_flattable. 

##### 3. many

For one to many relationship. With this type, we can store more than one entries
 in the flattable.

For example, books relationship with publishers_flattable, one publisher can have more than one
books.

### 6. flattable_column_name
Required when type is `many`. It holds the column name of the flattable, where json data will be stored.

### 7. delete_from_old_keys
Required when type is `many`. It holds the names of columns, any change in these columns will reload the related json data of related flattable column.


Configurations
--------------
### Disable flattable a single model
```php
Book::disableFlattable();

$book = factory(Book::class)->create();
$bookFlattable = BookFlattable::where('book_id', $book->id)->first();
$this->assertNull($bookFlattable);

Book::enableFlattable();
```

### Disable flattable for all models

set `disabled` to `true` in `config/flattabe.php`

```php
return [
    'console' => [
        'run' => true
    ],
    'disabled' => true
];
```

### Using callbacks
If none of available options works for your use case, you can pass a callback for `columns` and `wheres` configs.

For `columns` callback, you will receive model as parameter, and you should return data as array to be stored in flattable

```php
[
  ...

  'columns' => function (Country $country) {
    // when secondary row is deleted, it's data should be removed from flattable
    return [
      'publisher_country_name' => $country->exists ? $country->name ? null,
      'publisher_country_id' => $country->exists ? $country->id ? null
    ];
  }

  ...
]
```

For `wheres` callback, you will receive `QueryBuilder` and `Model` as parameters, and you can add as many conditionals as you want. 
```php
[
  ...
  'wheres' => function (Builder $db, Country $model) {
    $db->where('publisher_country_id', $model->id);
  }

  ...
]

```
